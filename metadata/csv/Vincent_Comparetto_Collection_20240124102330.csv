I believe in 2001 Josh Taylor’s fired everyone in the band including himself and then Amy Fantastic, Germaine Baca and Kenna (not sure on a last name) became “Josh Taylor's Friends Forever” who were around for a few years. All of the versions performed out of a Volkswagen Van that acted as a mobile performance space. Often pulling up to venues unannounced and playing in the street.
